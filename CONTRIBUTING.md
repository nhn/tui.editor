* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. Don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used a mouse or a keyboard.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets on the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.

* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
